# **Project 2: Help Desk Support (client side)**

This part of project 2 will be the client side.

# **Description**
For the second project, I am plannig on doing a tech support site where the user can create a ticket if they are experiencing an issue with thier pc. When the user is on the 'main page/login page', they should be able to only see the sign-up and sign-in form. The user can then sign up if they don't have an account and then sign in. If they are a returning user then they can just sign in. Once they're logged in, the user should then be able see the 'ticket page' and see the create ticket form, update a ticket, view all tickets, remove a ticket, change password form and the sign out button. They can then create a ticket where they would need to input the type of computer they have, the model number, the date they are creating the ticket and a breif description of the issue they are having. After creating the ticket, the user should be able to see all the tickets they have created or if they just want to see one ticket they should be able to do that as well. They can then update the ticket and/or remove a ticket too. The user should be able to change their password and sign out successfully as well.

# **Technologies Used**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- Bootstrap

# **Unsolved Issues/Future**
- One issue that I had was being able to display all the tickets in a modal. I've made a few attempts in doing so but kept breaking my code so I thought it would be best to leave it alone for now and give it a try later on.

- One thing that I would like to add later on as well is being able to display one ticket to the user and not just all of them at once. I would also like to add a third API like displaying the weather or time to the user.
